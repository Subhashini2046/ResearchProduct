Final appeals are being made for the government not to ditch the reform plan for England's secondary schools put forward by the Tomlinson report.The government's response to the plan for a four-tier diploma to replace all existing 14-19 qualifications is expected next week.He is said to be feeling more comfortable about what the government is likely to say than if he had read only what was in newspapers in the earlier part of the week.But the government was said to be still rewriting its response on Friday.His main concern was the reports that there would be a diploma - but only to replace existing vocational qualifications."It is not the case that the academic stream in secondary is fine while the vocational route is desperately weak".But people understand that a White Paper response is government policy and has to command wider ministerial support than if it were coming only from the Department for Education and Skills.They may be content if it does not "close too many doors" in writing - whatever spin is put on it."If we don't say this is a sea-change in education, we will miss a great opportunity".Universities and head teachers in both the independent and state sectors have also backed the Tomlinson proposals, which include having higher grades at advanced level to differentiate between the brightest students.It has been suggested the government will take steps of some sort to meet firms' concerns on this score.Another dissenter is Sir Mike Tomlinson's predecessor as chief schools inspector, Professor Chris Woodhead, who has said there is no need for such a "massive upheaval".The Conservative Party has put forward plans to revert to a system of having only the brightest percentage of students each year getting the top A-level grade, no matter how well the others have done.

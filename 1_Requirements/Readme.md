## Introduction
An automated teller machine (ATM) or the automatic banking machine (ABM) is acomputerized telecommunications device that provides the clients of a financial institution withaccess to financial transactions in a public space without the need for a cashier, human clerk orbank teller. On most modern ATMs, the customer is identified by inserting a plastic ATM cardwith a magnetic stripe or a plastic smart card with a chip that contains a unique card number andsome security information such as an expiration date. Authentication is provided by the customerentering a personal identification number (PIN) Using an ATM, customers can access their bank accounts:
        1. To make cash withdrawals
        2. Check their account balances
        3. Exchange rate for foreign travelers.
Example- If the currency being withdrawn from the ATM is different from that which the bank account is denominated in (e.g.: Withdrawing Japanese Yen from a bank account containing USDollars), the money will be converted at a wholesale exchange rate. Thus, ATMs often providethe best possible exchange rate for foreign travelers and are heavily used for this purpose as well.

The machines can enable depositors to withdraw cash at more convenient times and places than during banking hours at branches.

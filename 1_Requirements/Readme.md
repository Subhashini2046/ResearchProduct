## Introduction
Text summarization is the process of distilling the most important information from a source to produce an abridged version for a particular user and task. Humans are generally quite good at this task as we have the capacity to understand the meaning of a text document and extract salient features to summarize the documents using our own words. However, automatic methods for text summarization are crucial in today’s world where there is an over-abundance of data and lack of manpower as well as time to interpret the data. 

## Research

The intention of text summarization is to express the content of a document in a condensed form that meets the needs of the user . For more information than can realistically be digested is available on the World-Wide Web and in other electronic forms. News information, biographical information, minutes of meetings missed -- it isn't possible to read everything one would want to read and so some form of information condensation is needed. Secondly, the language of news media may be impenetrable to some people -- for example, children or people learning English as a foreign language. Some method of language simplication would be useful, as well as a method of providing the background knowledge adults take for granted. A solution that addressed both of those problems would enable a wider range of people to be aware of a greater amount of information.

## Cost and Features 
**Cost**
ATMs can vary in price ($2,000-$8,000), but typically the average new, freestanding ATM machine will cost around $2,300 – $3,000.

**Feature**

1. Summarizing reduces perusing time
2. While investigating reports, outlines make the determination procedure simpler
3. Summarization improves the adequacy of ordering
4. Summarization calculations are less one-sided than human summarizers
5. Personalized summaries are useful in question-answering systems as they provide personalized information
6. Utilizing programmed or Summarization frameworks empower business theoretical administrations to build the number of content archives they can process

## Who:

This system is helpful for all the people who want the summary for any Text document.

## What:

The Extractive text Summarization System summarizes the text of any document.

## When:
 **June 1967**
The first ATM was set up in June 1967 on a street in Enfield, London at a branch of Barclays bank. A British inventor named John Shepherd-Barron is credited with its invention. The machine allowed customers to withdraw a maximum of GBP10 at a time.

## Where:

ATMs can be placed at any location but are most often placed near or inside banks, shopping centers/malls, airports, railway stations, metro stations, grocery stores, petrol/gas stations, restaurants, and other locations. 

## How:

The ATM is an automatic banking machine (ABM) that allows the customer to complete basic transactions without any help from bank representativesAnyone with a credit card or debit card can access cash at most ATMs.

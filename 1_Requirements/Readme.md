## Introduction
 An air conditioner is a system that is used to cool down a space by removing heat from the space and moving it to some outside area. Air Conditioning has been defined as the process for treating air, so as to control simultaneously its temperature, humidity, cleanliness and distribution to meet the requirements of the conditioned space.Air conditioners require some input of work to operatre, otherwise entropy would decrease naturally which is forbidden by the Second law of thermodynamics. Air conditioners act similarly to a heat pump, but instead follow a cooling cycle. To cool, a substance known as a refrigerant is processed in the following steps:
 1. A cold liquid refrigerant absorbs heat from the hotter room in the evaporator, cooling the room down.
 2. The refrigerant then changes phase to a gas and is put through a compressor to increase its temperature.
 3. Refrigerant then passes through the condenser coils, transferring heat from the refrigerant to the outside air.
 4. Refrigerant expands in order to decrease its pressure and cool down to below the room's temperature to repeat the cycle again.

The air conditioner is a key component of the HVAC system, which focuses on home temperature control in order to maximize comfort and livability in a space.

## Research

HVAC is an acronym for heating, ventilating, and air conditioning. The term refers to a group of systems and machines used in buildings such as homes and buildings that regulate the indoor temperature and air quality to ensure comfort. In modern homes, these three functions are often combined into one system. These systems heat and cool air to a comfortable temperature, as well as providing comfortably humid air while improving air quality by bringing in fresh air. This incorporation of fresh air is particularly important in small spaces or high-odour areas.
The main goal of any air conditioner is to move cooled air from one area to another. Generally speaking, this involves taking indoor air and changing its temperature to what is comfortable and distributing this treated air around a building. Many central air conditioning units are known as "split system", as there is an outdoor condenser and an indoor evaporator coil that work to cool the house.
